Errors:

If a zero is included in the MTF encoding as an index and not
to represent repeated 1s, the encoder will assume it is for repeated
ones. There is no way for the encoder to handle this and it must be
assumed that the input is clean.

If an extremely large text file is used as the input, the memory
allocation requests might fail. This is handled in some of the provided
functions but not in mine. A simple solution would be to check if the
pointer returned by malloc is NULL and report the error accordingly.

If the size of the text file exceeds the maximum message size as defined
at the top of the program, a segfault will likely occur during the encoding
process. This can be prevented by checking the length of the file before doing
any processing on it and stopping the program if it's too large.
